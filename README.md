# Computing-EnvJustice

This repository is contains some code to generate a map displaying the carbon efficiency of states in the United States. The python file 'USStatesMap.py' uses the data from 'combined.csv' to draw a plot using pandas and plotly.
The full main project has a broader scope, and is exploring the environmental cost of the increasing demand for data centers. There may or may not be more files added depending on what kind of figures are needed or helpful for displaying the research done.
